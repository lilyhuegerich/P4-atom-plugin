## P4 Pipeline Generator

This is a Atom (text editor) plugin designed for the P4 programming language. It works well in conjunction to the P4 language highlighting plugin at https://atom.io/packages/language-p4.

Its purpose is to reduce the amount of redundant code lines to be written by making available P4 specific auto complete features.


### How to use
For basic assistance, please use the shortcut “cmd − alt − h”. Once the plugin is installed this shortcut will explain the usage of the program.
